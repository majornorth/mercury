# Todo List Status

This project has a single source of truth for implementation status: **TODO.md** at the repo root. It is aligned with the [PRD](docs/PRD-Risk-Operations-Platform.md) and [Technical Design](docs/Technical-Design-Risk-Operations-Platform.md).

## Required behavior

1. **Before making changes**
   - Read **TODO.md** to see what is done and what is left.
   - Use it to avoid duplicating work and to pick the right next items.

2. **After making changes**
   - Update **TODO.md** to reflect what you did:
     - Mark completed items with `[x]`.
     - Mark in-progress or partial work with `[-]` where appropriate.
     - Add new rows if you added scope not already listed.
   - Update the *Last updated* line at the bottom of **TODO.md** (e.g. with the current date or a short note that the agent last updated it).

## Conventions in TODO.md

- `[x]` = Done
- `[ ]` = Not started
- `[-]` = In progress or partially done
- Keep section and table structure; only change status cells and the last-updated line unless you are adding new work items.
